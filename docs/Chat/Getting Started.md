### Initial Empty Page

Upon accessing the Chat Page for the first time, you will be greeted with an empty chat interface. Here, you can see a
welcoming message and a set of suggestions to help you get started with your conversation.

Here is a short list of structure:

- Chat threads list where you can find all your chats and action buttons
- Welcoming page with suggestion how to start your chat
- Input area where you can write a question and send it with Regenerate response button
