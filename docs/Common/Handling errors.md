### 2.2. Check Your Internet Connection

A stable internet connection is essential for using web applications. If you encounter an error, check your internet
connection:

1. Ensure you are connected to the internet.
2. If you are on a Wi-Fi network, make sure it's functioning correctly.
3. If you are on a mobile network, ensure you have a strong signal.

### 2.3. Clear Browser Cache and Cookies

Stale browser data can sometimes cause issues. Clearing your browser's cache and cookies can help:

1. Access your browser's settings or preferences.
2. Find the option to clear cache and cookies.
3. Select this option and confirm to clear the data.
4. Close and reopen your browser.

## 3. Navigating Back to the Application

### 3.1. Using the Browser Back Button

If you find yourself on an error page, and you want to return to the previous screen within the application:

1. Locate the back button in your browser (usually an arrow pointing left).
2. Click the back button to navigate to the previous page.

### 3.2. Clicking on the Application Logo

Many web applications have their logo or home button in the header. Clicking on the application's logo or home button
often takes you back to the main page of the application.

### 3.3. Re-entering the Application URL

If you're unable to navigate back using the browser's navigation buttons or the application's logo, you can manually
re-enter the URL of the application in the address bar and press "Enter" to reload the main page.

By following these steps, you can effectively handle common errors that may occur while using the web application and
continue enjoying its features. If the issue persists or if you encounter specific error messages, don't hesitate to
